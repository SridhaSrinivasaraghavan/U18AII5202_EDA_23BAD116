## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Smart Campus Monitoring Dashboard** developed using **Power BI** to support data-driven monitoring in an AI-based smart campus environment. The dashboard provides real-time insights into student attendance, academic performance, and grade distribution to assist academic planning and decision-making.

---

## Objective

To design an interactive analytical dashboard that monitors key academic metrics such as attendance, performance, and grade distribution with filtering and drill-down capabilities.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this dashboard (`student_performance.csv`) contains academic and attendance records of students from an autonomous engineering institution. Each record corresponds to an individual student and includes the following attributes:

* **Student_ID** – Unique identifier for each student
* **Department** – Academic department (AI&DS, CSE, IT)
* **Semester** – Current semester of study
* **Attendance_Percentage** – Percentage of classes attended
* **Total_Score** – Aggregate academic performance score from internal assessments
* **Final_Grade** – Final academic grade obtained (A, B, C, D)

The dataset enables analysis of academic trends and performance comparisons across departments and semesters.

## Dashboard Features

### KPI Cards

* **Average Attendance Percentage**
* **Average Total Score (Academic Performance)**

These KPIs provide a quick overview of overall campus performance.

---

### Visualizations

* **Pie Chart:** Distribution of students by Final Grade
* **Bar Chart:** Average Total Score by Department
* **Slicers:** Department and Semester filters

---

### Interactivity

* Dynamic filtering using slicers
* Cross-filtering between visuals
* Drill-down analysis for department- and semester-level insights

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Power BI Desktop
* CSV Dataset
* Interactive Visualizations (Cards, Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Slicers)

---

## Key Insights

* Highlights academic performance variations across departments
* Displays grade distribution patterns
* Supports focused analysis using semester and department filters

---

## Repository Contents

* Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`)
* Dataset (`student_performance.csv`)
* Dashboard screenshots
* Documentation
* README file

---

## Outcome

The Smart Campus Monitoring Dashboard provides a centralized, interactive platform for monitoring student attendance and academic performance, enabling informed academic planning and AI-driven campus management.
