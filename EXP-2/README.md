## Objective

To explore data distribution, variability, and abnormal purchase patterns in e-commerce transaction data using visualization techniques in R.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`ecommerce_transactions.csv`) contains transaction-level information including:

* Transaction Date
* Transaction Amount
* Customer purchase records across multiple months

The data is analyzed to understand spending behavior and identify unusual transactions.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

* R Programming
* ggplot2
* dplyr
* tidyr

---

## Visualizations Implemented

### 1. Histogram – Transaction Amount Distribution

* Displays frequency distribution of transaction values
* Helps analyze customer spending patterns

### 2. Boxplot – Outlier Detection

* Identifies abnormal or extreme transactions
* Useful for detecting fraud or high-value purchases

### 3. Heatmap – Monthly Sales Intensity

* Shows aggregated monthly transaction volume
* Highlights peak sales periods and seasonal trends

## Workflow Summary

1. Load dataset
2. Clean missing transaction values
3. Convert date format
4. Analyze distribution of transactions
5. Detect outliers
6. Aggregate monthly sales
7. Visualize intensity using heatmap

---

## Outcome

The experiment successfully demonstrates:

* Spending distribution of customers
* Identification of abnormal transactions
* Monthly sales trends and intensity patterns
